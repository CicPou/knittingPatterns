# Cellular automata/game of life hat

The below makes an 18 inch circumference hat with a 'game of life' textured pattern on it. It was a fairly snug fit on my small (22 inch circumference) head.

Gauge = 4 stitches per inch  
Needles = I used 4mm circular needles. You can use whatever size gets the above gauge.

## Rim of hat

Cast on 72 stitches using a loose-ish long-tail cast on (or your preferred method for a stretchy edge) and join securely in the round.

round 1: *knit*   
round 2: *purl*

Or you can do round 1 = *purl*, round 2 = *knit*, to get a slightly different (more invisible?) edge. Both are nice in my opinion.

Repeat until the rim is as thick as you like it. I prefer something between 1 and 1.5 inches so that it is nice and thick over my ears :-)

## Pattern

The hat is knitted as if it has two symmetrical 'sides'. I recommend you put markers at the end of each round and also half way around, so that you know where each side begins and ends.

round 1: *knit 3, purl 1, knit3* repeated 5 times, *purl* last stitch. Do this twice to get all the way around.  
round 2 and all subsequent rows until you need to decrease: follow the rules below…

## Rules

If one and only one of the following three stitches is a purl, do a purl, otherwise do a knit:

* the last stitch worked (not the stitch that was just created, but the one 'below' that)
* the next 2 stitches to be worked

The last stitch of each half row (i.e. the stitch before each marker) must always be purled. Also you do need to count it as a purl stitch when beginning the next half row. The reason for always purling the last stitch is to maintain 'life' in the hat (and stop it from just reverting to knit stitches).

## Decrease

Start the decrease when the hat seems big enough (i.e. covers most of your head). Ideally also start the decrease at a suitable juncture in the pattern i.e. not half-way through any of the massive triangles that appear in the pattern sometimes.

round 1: *knit*    
round 2: *k7, k2tog*   
round 3: *k6, k2tog*  
round 4: *k5, k2tog*  

You may want to change to double pointed needles about now, if it is getting a bit tight…

round 5: *k4, k2tog*     
round 6: *k3, k2tog*    
round 7: *k2tog*  
round 8: *knit*  

Cut the yarn, leaving a tail. Thread it onto a darning needle and run it through all of the stitches. Pull it tight, and pull it back through the inside of the hat. Weave in all ends.

## Variations

Note that the pattern can be adapted to use contrasting colours instead of knit and purl stitches. This can be seen in the .jpg alongside this .md file. To do this, work the rim in the main colour, then substitute as follows in the pattern/rules:

* knit in main colour instead of knit stitches
* knit in contrasting colour instead of purl stitches

You will inevitably need to sometimes carry the non-working colour along the back as you work your way around e.g. twist it with the working colour every five stitches or so. This will stop it from forming giant loops of yarn that are liable to tangle or get in the way when you put your hat on. Don't make the loops too tight though, otherwise your hat won't stretch enough when you put it on.

It is up to you whether/how to incorporate the contrasting colour in the decrease. I haven't figured out how to keep the pattern going properly whilst decreasing… maybe you can.

Note also that there are many possible ways of generating 'game of life' patterns. This is just one. It was inspired by Debbie New's use of cellular automata in her fabulous book Unexpected Knitting. Feel free to learn more about cellular automata/Conway's game of life and generate your own patterns.

## Note
I think it might be more aesthetically pleasing to do round 1 differently. What happens with the above is that round 1 gets quite a lot of purl stitches going, which are then 'killed off' a few rows later. This creates a few rows with no obvious pattern, followed by the start of a giant Sierpinski triangle. This looks a bit weird to me. It might be better to do something with just a few purl stitches around the 36th and 72nd stitches, e.g.:

round 1: *knit 35, purl 1*. Do this twice to get all the way around.  
round 2 and all subsequent rows until you need to decrease: follow the Rules above...

I may have tried this approach when I created the contrasting colour version of the have (as shown in the accompanying .jpg), but my memory is hazy. I will leave it up to you to experiment and see what works and what doesn't.
